# Hello ! #
![Guillermo Álvarez](/images/me.png)

__I am web developer and this is my bio__

## Present ##

From the last year I am a **happy spanish freelance**. That let me work with _geoposition systems_ (Maps) and _mobile web apps_ (localStorage, JSON, html5 manifest), _nosql_ **[CoudDB](http://couchdb.apache.org)** and **[ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org)**, **[Memcache](http://memcached.org)**, **Javascript** (by hand or with coffee).

I normally manage my own server (FreeBSD and Linux), currently I use **CHEF**, **MUNIN** and **MONIT** and if possible **UPSTART**, normally serverd with **nginx** and **passenger**.

I love Wireframes, Usability, User Experience, Grid Based Designs, and agile management systems (not necessary scrum or kanban).

In my spare time I am playing with **[Puredata](http://puredata.info/)**, **[Mongrel2](http://mongrel2.org/)**, **[ZMQ](http://www.zeromq.org/)** and learning **[Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/)**. 

*Active member* of the **[spanish ruby community](http://www.spainrb.org)**, organizing this and last year **[Conferencia Rails](http://conferenciarails.org)**, involved and occasionally speaker in **[madridrb](https://madridrb.jottit.com/)**.


## History ##
I am a software/web/technology craftsman since 16. Start programing with **basic**, but _.exe_ where cooler than _.bas_, so I move to **C**. The problem with that and _3d graphics_, was the **speed** of the graphics.lib from borland compiler, so i learn enough x86 **assambler** to made my own libraries for 3d graphics with the _int-10_ of the **MS-DOS** system.

If you are curious, you always ask why something work, so the next logic step was **electronics** and **robotics** were I participate in few _robotic contests_.

I start the university (Politécnica de Madrid) in 2004 and leave a few years later after some good parties and a few honours because that was not the education I
wanted for me. After the first year I start working with a control systems and automation equipment distributor as a technical and commercial employee, dealing with problems in _airports_, _automated warehouses_ and _factories_ researching for technical solutions to everyday problems.

In that company I also suscesfully migrate the _management and accounting systems_ and the _desktop environments_ to **Open Source** solutions like **[LTS](http://www.ltsp.org/)** or **[XEN](http://www.xen.org/)**.

By the 2008 I completely change my professional career to something more related with my principal hobby, so I start working with _[La coctelera](http://lococtelera.com)_ maybe the first company in spain usign **[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)** for production, and for sure, the biggest blog engine in Spain. I do the migration to **[GIT](http://git-scm.com/)**, the _asyncroniusly image upload service_ based on **Amazon EC2** with custom AMI, and the _full text search engine_ with **[Sphinx](http://sphinxsearch.com/)**

The next hop was *[Job And Talent](http://jobandtalent.com)* the _spanish recruitment social network_ were i worked on the _candidate search function_ and _dynamic generation pdf_ with help of **[groff](http://www.gnu.org/software/groff/)** unix command as a rails view format.
